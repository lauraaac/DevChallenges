In time complexity:

1. We travese all the egdes given in input and storage in dict, it takes
O(n) where n is number of edges.

2. We travese for all nodes in tree, then it takes O(n) as well.

3. Create dictionary with distance from currect node to other, it just taken one operation,
then O(1)

4. For each one node executes "depthFirst" fuction.

    4.1 We traverse each element in adjacent list of node, thus, it takes in
    worst case where all nodes are conected with one O(n)

    4.2 Check if the current node is diferent to parent node, just to avoid cycles.
    It just takes one operation, then O(1)

    4.3 Increment distance from one to others taking into account the distance from parent.
    We use dictionary, then it just takes one operation and it takes O(1)

    4.4 Use recursively fuction with each child node. 

Considering all above,

time = 


In space complexity:

  

then, Considering
